# Welcome to AVA! 

## What is AVA

AVA is: 

* A heterogeneous network of custom, interoperable blockchains and custom validator sets
* A platform for defining, launching and maintaining custom blockchains
* A platform for creating and trading smart digital assets
* A way to store and transfer value without a centralized entity

## Key Features

### Speed

AVA uses Avalanche, a consensus protocol created by distributed systems researchers in 2018, to permanently confirm transactions in 1-2 seconds.

### Scalability

AVA handles thousands of transactions per second and can accommodate thousands of validators with no loss of performance.

### Security 

Avalanche provides stronger security guarantees than either classical or longest-chain consensus protocols.

### Private/public Blockchains

Users can create their own public or private blockchains.

### Finance-focused
AVA was built with serving financial markets in mind.
It has native support for easily creating and trading digital smart assets with complex custom rulesets 
that define how the asset is handled and traded.
The assets could represent financial instruments such as equities, bonds, debt,
fractionalized real estate, or anything else.
