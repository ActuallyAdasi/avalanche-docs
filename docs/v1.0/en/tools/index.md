# Developer Tools

The two main developers tools for the AVA Platform are Avash and Avalanche.

## Avash &mdash; The AVA Shell Client

[Avash](./avash.md) is a shell client for interacting with the AVA Platform. Avash can deploy local networks and interact with the nodes in those networks. Its main use case is rapidly launching test network environments.

## Avalanche.js &mdash; The AVA Platform JavaScript Library

[Avalanche.js](./avalanche.js/index.md) is a JavaScript library written in TypesScript which enables browser and Node.js clients to make API calls to AVA nodes. It provides a wide suite of tools to make asset creation, balance management, and funds transfer easy. Avalanche has tools for managing the node itself, accessing the Admin, Keystore, and Platform APIs built into AVA nodes.
